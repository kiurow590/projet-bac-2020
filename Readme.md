# Project Presentation

## Project Objective

**Kultom!** is a small educational video game designed in the form of a quiz to highlight general knowledge. The game takes place in a pixelated world and offers three distinct themes: music, science fiction, and computing. Each level must be completed to reach the final confrontation against a formidable "boss." The game's ending is dynamic, varying based on the player's victory or defeat.

## Writing and Scenario

The storyline begins with the crash of a meteorite in the world of Kultomax. The protagonist, **Sam**, intrigued by the incident, leaves his home to investigate the cause of the crash. To solve this mystery, he must navigate through different areas: **MusicaCity**, **Fantasia**, and **Infortos**. Each location is linked to one of the three quiz themes. At the end of his journey, Sam faces an invasion of aliens emerging from the meteorite and must fight them to save his world.

## Project Creation

The main idea was to create an original video game combining education and entertainment. We chose to associate general knowledge with a video game to make it an engaging and interactive experience. The game's name, **Kultom!**, is inspired directly by the word "culture," reflecting the core concept of the project.
